# Rocktly: Rocket launches schedule (Work in progress üößüë∑üèóÔ∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è)

üö® App is currently being rewritten to compose üö®

An android app that shows timeline of upcoming rocket launches. Showcases architecture of a real android application and usage of some libraries. Application loads data about rocket launches from the server and stores them to the database for off-line usage.

### Goals

- Modularize the application into modules `App` and `Domain`. `Domain` module has no android dependencies.
- Focus on testability with unit tests and UI tests. For UI tests is used the Espresso library with the [Robot pattern](https://academy.realm.io/posts/kau-jake-wharton-testing-robots/) which allows to create clear and understandable tests.
- Use kotlin coroutines for asynchronous jobs.

### Libraries Used

- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - Store launch data received from the server in SQLite database.
- [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
- [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Handle events from ViewModel to Fragments/Activity.
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - Used for periodic data fetching from server and for showing Android notification of upcoming launch.
- [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) - Handle everything needed for navigation between fragments and creation of deep links.
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) For managing asynchronous calls with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks. For event based code are used `Flow`-s and `Channel`-s.
- Dependency injection
  - [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) Creates dependency graph for most object in the application.
  - [Assited-Inject](https://github.com/square/AssistedInject) Easier creation of objects that combine parameterization and dependencies. Mainly used with ViewModels.

- [Material components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) Application uses material theme for easier styling of UI components and for dark theme.  

### Getting started

- Server for app isn't currently running publicly. App should work even without server, when is build with parameter `use_fake_reponse_api=true` in the `gradle.properiets`. In this case the response is generated from static JSON from the assets.

#### Gradle tasks

- run UI tests on connected device:
`./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`

- run unit tests:
`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`

- assemble apk:
`./gradlew assembleDebug`

#### Environment variables (optional)

- `SPACE_APP_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`

- `SPACE_APP_KEY_PASSWORD`

- `SPACE_APP_KEYSTORE_PATH`

- `SPACE_APP_API_KEY` - key will be used for communication with server, but is recommended for now to use `use_fake_reponse_api=true ` parameter in the `gradle.properiets`.

- `SPACE_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` - use a google maps api key and replace google-services.json file, if you want to show the map in the Launch detail.
